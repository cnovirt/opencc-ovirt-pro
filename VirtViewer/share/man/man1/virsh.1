.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBvirsh\fP program is the main interface for managing virsh guest
domains. The program can be used to create, pause, and shutdown
domains. It can also be used to list current domains. Libvirt is a C
toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of recent
versions of Linux (and other OSes). It is free software available
under the GNU Lesser General Public License. Virtualization of the
Linux Operating System means the ability to run multiple instances of
Operating Systems concurrently on a single hardware system where the
basic resources are driven by a Linux instance. The library aims at
providing a long term stable C API.  It currently supports Xen, QEMU,
KVM, LXC, OpenVZ, VirtualBox and VMware ESX.
.sp
The basic structure of most virsh usage is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
virsh [OPTION]... <command> <domain> [ARG]...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Where \fIcommand\fP is one of the commands listed below; \fIdomain\fP is the
numeric domain id, or the domain name, or the domain UUID; and \fIARGS\fP
are command specific options.  There are a few exceptions to this rule
in the cases where the command in question acts on all domains, the
entire machine, or directly on the xen hypervisor.  Those exceptions
will be clear for each of those commands.  Note: it is permissible to
give numeric names to domains, however, doing so will result in a
domain that can only be identified by domain id. In other words, if a
numeric value is supplied it will be interpreted as a domain id, not
as a name. Any \fIcommand\fP starting with \fB#\fP is treated as a comment
and silently ignored, all other unrecognized \fIcommands\fP are diagnosed.
.sp
The \fBvirsh\fP program can be used either to run one \fICOMMAND\fP by giving the
command and its arguments on the shell command line, or a \fICOMMAND_STRING\fP
which is a single shell argument consisting of multiple \fICOMMAND\fP actions
and their arguments joined with whitespace and separated by semicolons or
newlines between commands, where unquoted backslash\-newline pairs are
elided.  Within \fICOMMAND_STRING\fP, virsh understands the
same single, double, and backslash escapes as the shell, although you must
add another layer of shell escaping in creating the single shell argument,
and any word starting with unquoted \fI#\fP begins a comment that ends at newline.
If no command is given in the command line, \fBvirsh\fP will then start a minimal
interpreter waiting for your commands, and the \fBquit\fP command will then exit
the program.
.sp
The \fBvirsh\fP program understands the following \fIOPTIONS\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-connect\fP \fIURI\fP
.sp
Connect to the specified \fIURI\fP, as if by the \fBconnect\fP command,
instead of the default connection.
.sp
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-debug\fP \fILEVEL\fP
.sp
Enable debug messages at integer \fILEVEL\fP and above.  \fILEVEL\fP can
range from 0 to 4 (default).  See the documentation of \fBVIRSH_DEBUG\fP
environment variable below for the description of each \fILEVEL\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-\-escape\fP \fIstring\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Set alternative escape sequence for \fIconsole\fP command. By default,
telnet\(aqs \fB^]\fP is used. Allowed characters when using hat notation are:
alphabetic character, @, [, ], , ^, _.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Ignore all other arguments, and behave as if the \fBhelp\fP command were
given instead.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-k\fP, \fB\-\-keepalive\-interval\fP \fIINTERVAL\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Set an \fIINTERVAL\fP (in seconds) for sending keepalive messages to
check whether connection to the server is still alive.  Setting the
interval to 0 disables client keepalive mechanism.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-K\fP, \fB\-\-keepalive\-count\fP \fICOUNT\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Set a number of times keepalive message can be sent without getting an
answer from the server without marking the connection dead.  There is
no effect to this setting in case the \fIINTERVAL\fP is set to 0.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-log\fP \fIFILE\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Output logging details to \fIFILE\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-version[=short]\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp

virsh is coming from
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version=long\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Ignore all other arguments, and prints the version of the libvirt library
virsh is coming from and which options and driver are compiled in.
.SH NOTES
.sp
Most \fBvirsh\fP operations rely upon the libvirt library being able to
connect to an already running libvirtd service.  This can usually be
done using the command \fBservice libvirtd start\fP\&.
.sp
Most \fBvirsh\fP commands require root privileges to run due to the
communications channels used to talk to the hypervisor.  Running as
non root will return an error.
.sp
Most \fBvirsh\fP commands act synchronously, except maybe shutdown,
setvcpus and setmem. In those cases the fact that the \fBvirsh\fP
program returned, may not mean the action is complete and you
must poll periodically to detect that the guest completed the
operation.
.sp
\fBvirsh\fP strives for backward compatibility.  Although the \fBhelp\fP
command only lists the preferred usage of a command, if an older
version of \fBvirsh\fP supported an alternate spelling of a command or
option (such as \fI\-\-tunnelled\fP instead of \fI\-\-tunneled\fP), then
scripts using that older spelling will continue to work.
.sp
Several \fBvirsh\fP commands take an optionally scaled integer; if no
scale is provided, then the default is listed in the command (for
historical reasons, some commands default to bytes, while other
commands default to kibibytes).  The following case\-insensitive
suffixes can be used to select a specific scale:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.sp
Print an XML document describing the domain capabilities for the
hypervisor we are connected to using information either sourced from an
existing domain or taken from the \fBvirsh capabilities\fP output. This may
be useful if you intend to create a new domain and are curious if for
instance it could make use of VFIO by creating a domain for the
hypervisor with a specific emulator and architecture.
.sp
Each hypervisor will have different requirements regarding which options
are required and which are optional. A hypervisor can support providing
a default value for any of the options.
.sp
The \fIvirttype\fP option specifies the virtualization type used. The value
to be used is either from the \(aqtype\(aq attribute of the <domain/> top
level element from the domain XML or the \(aqtype\(aq attribute found within
each <guest/> element from the \fBvirsh capabilities\fP output.  The
\fIemulatorbin\fP option specifies the path to the emulator. The value to
be used is either the <emulator> element in the domain XML or the
\fBvirsh capabilities\fP output. The \fIarch\fP option specifies the
architecture to be used for the domain. The value to be used is either
the "arch" attribute from the domain\(aqs XML <os/> element and <type/>
subelement or the "name" attribute of an <arch/> element from the
\fBvirsh capabililites\fP output. The \fImachine\fP specifies the machine type
for the emulator. The value to be used is either the "machine" attribute
from the domain\(aqs XML <os/> element and <type/> subelement or one from a
list of machines from the \fBvirsh capabilities\fP output for a specific
architecture and domain type.
.sp
For the QEMU hypervisor, a \fIvirttype\fP of either \(aqqemu\(aq or \(aqkvm\(aq must be
supplied along with either the \fIemulatorbin\fP or \fIarch\fP in order to
generate output for the default \fImachine\fP\&.  Supplying a \fImachine\fP
value will generate output for the specific machine.

.sp
Name is the name of the domain.  ID the domain numeric id.
State is the run state (see below).
.sp
\fBSTATES\fP
.sp
The State field lists what state each domain is currently in. A domain
can be in one of the following possible states:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrunning\fP
.sp
The domain is currently running on a CPU
.IP \(bu 2
\fBidle\fP
.sp
The domain is idle, and not running or runnable.  This can be caused
because the domain is waiting on IO (a traditional wait state) or has
gone to sleep because there was nothing else for it to do.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpaused\fP
.sp
The domain has been paused, usually occurring through the administrator
running \fBvirsh suspend\fP\&.  When in a paused state the domain will still
consume allocated resources like memory, but will not be eligible for
scheduling by the hypervisor.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBin shutdown\fP
.sp
The domain is in the process of shutting down, i.e. the guest operating system
has been notified and should be in the process of stopping its operations
gracefully.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBshut off\fP
.sp
The domain is not running.  Usually this indicates the domain has been
shut down completely, or has not been started.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcrashed\fP
.sp
The domain has crashed, which is always a violent ending.  Usually
this state can only occur if the domain has been configured not to
restart on crash.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpmsuspended\fP
.sp
The domain has been suspended by guest power management, e.g. entered
into s3 state.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Normally only active domains are listed. To list inactive domains specify
\fI\-\-inactive\fP or \fI\-\-all\fP to list both active and inactive domains.
.sp
\fBFiltering\fP
.sp
To further filter the list of domains you may specify one or more of filtering
flags supported by the \fBlist\fP command. These flags are grouped by function.
Specifying one or more flags from a group enables the filter group. Note that
some combinations of flags may yield no results. Supported filtering flags and
groups:
.SS Persistence
.sp
Flag \fI\-\-persistent\fP is used to include persistent domains in the returned
list. To include transient domains specify \fI\-\-transient\fP\&.
.SS Existence of managed save image
.sp
To list domains having a managed save image specify flag
\fI\-\-with\-managed\-save\fP\&. For domains that don\(aqt have a managed save image
specify \fI\-\-without\-managed\-save\fP\&.
.SS Domain state
.sp
The following filter flags select a domain by its state:
\fI\-\-state\-running\fP for running domains, \fI\-\-state\-paused\fP  for paused domains,
\fI\-\-state\-shutoff\fP for turned off domains and \fI\-\-state\-other\fP for all
other states as a fallback.
.SS Autostarting domains
.sp
To list autostarting domains use the flag \fI\-\-autostart\fP\&. To list domains with
this feature disabled use \fI\-\-no\-autostart\fP\&.
.SS Snapshot existence
.sp
Domains that have snapshot images can be listed using flag \fI\-\-with\-snapshot\fP,
domains without a snapshot \fI\-\-without\-snapshot\fP\&.
.SS Checkpoint existence
.sp
Domains that have checkpoints can be listed using flag \fI\-\-with\-checkpoint\fP,
domains without a checkpoint \fI\-\-without\-checkpoint\fP\&.
.sp
When talking to older servers, this command is forced to use a series of API
calls with an inherent race, where a domain might not be listed or might appear
more than once if it changed state between calls while the list was being
collected.  Newer servers do not have this problem.
.sp
If \fI\-\-managed\-save\fP is specified, then domains that have managed save state
(only possible if they are in the \fBshut off\fP state, so you need to specify
\fI\-\-inactive\fP or \fI\-\-all\fP to actually list them) will instead show as \fBsaved\fP
in the listing. This flag is usable only with the default \fI\-\-table\fP output.
Note that this flag does not filter the list of domains.
.sp
If \fI\-\-name\fP is specified, domain names are printed instead of the table
formatted one per line. If \fI\-\-uuid\fP is specified domain\(aqs UUID\(aqs are printed
instead of names. Flag \fI\-\-table\fP specifies that the legacy table\-formatted
output should be used. This is the default.
.sp
If both \fI\-\-name\fP and \fI\-\-uuid\fP are specified, domain UUID\(aqs and names
are printed side by side without any header. Flag \fI\-\-table\fP specifies
that the legacy table\-formatted output should be used. This is the
default if neither \fI\-\-name\fP nor \fI\-\-uuid\fP are specified. Option
\fI\-\-table\fP is mutually exclusive with options \fI\-\-uuid\fP and \fI\-\-name\fP\&.
.sp
If \fI\-\-title\fP is specified, then the short domain description (title) is
printed in an extra column. This flag is usable only with the default
\fI\-\-table\fP output.

\fIpagecount\fP is taken as the new absolute size of the pool (this

Compute baseline CPU which will be supported by all host CPUs given in <file>.
(See \fBhypervisor\-cpu\-baseline\fP command to get a CPU which can be provided by a
specific hypervisor.) The list of host CPUs is built by extracting all <cpu>
elements from the <file>. Thus, the <file> can contain either a set of <cpu>
elements separated by new lines or even a set of complete <capabilities>
elements printed by \fBcapabilities\fP command.  If \fI\-\-features\fP is specified,
then the resulting XML description will explicitly include all features that
make up the CPU, without this option features that are part of the CPU model
will not be listed in the XML description.   If \fI\-\-migratable\fP is specified,
features that block migration will not be included in the resulting CPU.

which a specific hypervisor is able to provide on the host.) The XML <file> may
contain either host or guest CPU definition. The host CPU definition is the
<cpu> element and its contents as printed by \fBcapabilities\fP command. The
guest CPU definition is the <cpu> element and its contents from domain XML
definition or the CPU definition created from the host CPU model found in
domain capabilities XML (printed by \fBdomcapabilities\fP command). In
addition to the <cpu> element itself, this command accepts
full domain XML, capabilities XML, or domain capabilities XML containing
the CPU definition. For more information on guest CPU definition see:
\fI\%https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU\fP\&. If \fI\-\-error\fP is

Whether a specific hypervisor is able to create a domain which uses any of
the printed CPU models is a separate question which can be answered by
looking at the domain capabilities XML returned by \fBdomcapabilities\fP command.
Moreover, for some architectures libvirt does not know any CPU models and
the usable CPU models are only limited by the hypervisor. This command will
print that all CPU models are accepted for these architectures and the actual
list of supported CPU models can be checked in the domain capabilities XML.

.sp
Compare CPU definition from XML <file> with the CPU the hypervisor is able to
provide on the host. (This is different from \fBcpu\-compare\fP which compares the
CPU definition with the host CPU without considering any specific hypervisor
and its abilities.)
.sp
The XML \fIFILE\fP may contain either a host or guest CPU definition. The host CPU
definition is the <cpu> element and its contents as printed by the
\fBcapabilities\fP command. The guest CPU definition is the <cpu> element and its
contents from the domain XML definition or the CPU definition created from the
host CPU model found in the domain capabilities XML (printed by the
\fBdomcapabilities\fP command). In addition to the <cpu> element itself, this
command accepts full domain XML, capabilities XML, or domain capabilities XML
containing the CPU definition. For more information on guest CPU definition
see: \fI\%https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU\fP\&.
.sp
The \fIvirttype\fP option specifies the virtualization type (usable in the \(aqtype\(aq
attribute of the <domain> top level element from the domain XML). \fIemulator\fP
specifies the path to the emulator, \fIarch\fP specifies the CPU architecture, and
\fImachine\fP specifies the machine type. If \fI\-\-error\fP is specified, the command
will return an error when the given CPU is incompatible with the host CPU and a
message providing more details about the incompatibility will be printed out.

Compute a baseline CPU which will be compatible with all CPUs defined in an XML
\fIfile\fP and with the CPU the hypervisor is able to provide on the host. (This
is different from \fBcpu\-baseline\fP which does not consider any hypervisor
abilities when computing the baseline CPU.)
.sp
The XML \fIFILE\fP may contain either host or guest CPU definitions describing the
host CPU model. The host CPU definition is the <cpu> element and its contents
as printed by \fBcapabilities\fP command. The guest CPU definition may be created
from the host CPU model found in domain capabilities XML (printed by
\fBdomcapabilities\fP command). In addition to the <cpu> elements, this command
accepts full capabilities XMLs, or domain capabilities XMLs containing the CPU
definitions. For best results, use only the CPU definitions from domain
capabilities.
.sp
When \fIFILE\fP contains only a single CPU definition, the command will print the
same CPU with restrictions imposed by the capabilities of the hypervisor.
Specifically, running th \fBvirsh hypervisor\-cpu\-baseline\fP command with no
additional options on the result of \fBvirsh domcapabilities\fP will transform the
host CPU model from domain capabilities XML to a form directly usable in domain
XML.
.sp
The \fIvirttype\fP option specifies the virtualization type (usable in the \(aqtype\(aq
attribute of the <domain> top level element from the domain XML). \fIemulator\fP
specifies the path to the emulator, \fIarch\fP specifies the CPU architecture, and
\fImachine\fP specifies the machine type. If \fI\-\-features\fP is specified, then the
resulting XML description will explicitly include all features that make up the
CPU, without this option features that are part of the CPU model will not be
listed in the XML description. If \fI\-\-migratable\fP is specified, features that
block migration will not be included in the resulting CPU.
.SH DOMAIN COMMANDS

\fIdomain\fP (see also \fBdomblklist\fP for listing these names).
.sp
If no limit is specified, it will query current I/O limits setting.
Otherwise, alter the limits with these flags:
\fI\-\-total\-bytes\-sec\fP specifies total throughput limit as a scaled integer, the
default being bytes per second if no suffix is specified.
\fI\-\-read\-bytes\-sec\fP specifies read throughput limit as a scaled integer, the
default being bytes per second if no suffix is specified.
\fI\-\-write\-bytes\-sec\fP specifies write throughput limit as a scaled integer, the
default being bytes per second if no suffix is specified.
\fI\-\-total\-iops\-sec\fP specifies total I/O operations limit per second.
\fI\-\-read\-iops\-sec\fP specifies read I/O operations limit per second.
\fI\-\-write\-iops\-sec\fP specifies write I/O operations limit per second.
\fI\-\-total\-bytes\-sec\-max\fP specifies maximum total throughput limit as a scaled
integer, the default being bytes per second if no suffix is specified
\fI\-\-read\-bytes\-sec\-max\fP specifies maximum read throughput limit as a scaled
integer, the default being bytes per second if no suffix is specified.
\fI\-\-write\-bytes\-sec\-max\fP specifies maximum write throughput limit as a scaled
integer, the default being bytes per second if no suffix is specified.
\fI\-\-total\-iops\-sec\-max\fP specifies maximum total I/O operations limit per second.
\fI\-\-read\-iops\-sec\-max\fP specifies maximum read I/O operations limit per second.
\fI\-\-write\-iops\-sec\-max\fP specifies maximum write I/O operations limit per second.
\fI\-\-total\-bytes\-sec\-max\-length\fP specifies duration in seconds to allow maximum
total throughput limit.
\fI\-\-read\-bytes\-sec\-max\-length\fP specifies duration in seconds to allow maximum
read throughput limit.
\fI\-\-write\-bytes\-sec\-max\-length\fP specifies duration in seconds to allow maximum
write throughput limit.
\fI\-\-total\-iops\-sec\-max\-length\fP specifies duration in seconds to allow maximum
total I/O operations limit.
\fI\-\-read\-iops\-sec\-max\-length\fP specifies duration in seconds to allow maximum
read I/O operations limit.
\fI\-\-write\-iops\-sec\-max\-length\fP specifies duration in seconds to allow maximum
write I/O operations limit.
\fI\-\-size\-iops\-sec\fP specifies size I/O operations limit per second.
\fI\-\-group\-name\fP specifies group name to share I/O quota between multiple drives.
For a QEMU domain, if no name is provided, then the default is to have a single
group for each \fIdevice\fP\&.
.sp
Older versions of virsh only accepted these options with underscore
instead of dash, as in \fI\-\-total_bytes_sec\fP\&.
.sp
Bytes and iops values are independent, but setting only one value (such
as \-\-read\-bytes\-sec) resets the other two in that category to unlimited.
An explicit 0 also clears any limit.  A non\-zero value for a given total
cannot be mixed with non\-zero values for read or write.
.sp
It is up to the hypervisor to determine how to handle the length values.
For the QEMU hypervisor, if an I/O limit value or maximum value is set,
then the default value of 1 second will be displayed. Supplying a 0 will
reset the value back to the default.
.sp
If \fI\-\-live\fP is specified, affect a running guest.
If \fI\-\-config\fP is specified, affect the next boot of a persistent guest.
If \fI\-\-current\fP is specified, affect the current guest state.
When setting the disk io parameters both \fI\-\-live\fP and \fI\-\-config\fP flags may be
given, but \fI\-\-current\fP is exclusive. For querying only one of \fI\-\-live\fP,
\fI\-\-config\fP or \fI\-\-current\fP can be specified. If no flag is specified, behavior
is different depending on hypervisor.

Reduce the length of a backing image chain, by committing changes at the
top of the chain (snapshot or delta files) into backing images.  By
default, this command attempts to flatten the entire chain.  If \fIbase\fP
and/or \fItop\fP are specified as files within the backing chain, then the
operation is constrained to committing just that portion of the chain;
\fI\-\-shallow\fP can be used instead of \fIbase\fP to specify the immediate
backing file of the resulting top image to be committed.  The files
being committed are rendered invalid, possibly as soon as the operation
starts; using the \fI\-\-delete\fP flag will attempt to remove these invalidated
files at the successful completion of the commit operation. When the
\fI\-\-keep\-relative\fP flag is used, the backing file paths will be kept relative.
.sp
When \fItop\fP is omitted or specified as the active image, it is also
possible to specify \fI\-\-active\fP to trigger a two\-phase active commit. In
the first phase, \fItop\fP is copied into \fIbase\fP and the job can only be
canceled, with top still containing data not yet in base. In the second
phase, \fItop\fP and \fIbase\fP remain identical until a call to \fBblockjob\fP
with the \fI\-\-abort\fP flag (keeping top as the active image that tracks
changes from that point in time) or the \fI\-\-pivot\fP flag (making base
the new active image and invalidating top).
.sp
By default, this command returns as soon as possible, and data for
the entire disk is committed in the background; the progress of the
operation can be checked with \fBblockjob\fP\&.  However, if \fI\-\-wait\fP is
specified, then this command will block until the operation completes
(or for \fI\-\-active\fP, enters the second phase), or until the operation
is canceled because the optional \fItimeout\fP in seconds elapses
or SIGINT is sent (usually with \fBCtrl\-C\fP).  Using \fI\-\-verbose\fP along
with \fI\-\-wait\fP will produce periodic status updates.  If job cancellation
is triggered, \fI\-\-async\fP will return control to the user as fast as
possible, otherwise the command may continue to block a little while
longer until the job is done cleaning up.  Using \fI\-\-pivot\fP is shorthand
for combining \fI\-\-active\fP \fI\-\-wait\fP with an automatic \fBblockjob\fP
\fI\-\-pivot\fP; and using \fI\-\-keep\-overlay\fP is shorthand for combining
\fI\-\-active\fP \fI\-\-wait\fP with an automatic \fBblockjob\fP \fI\-\-abort\fP\&.
.sp
\fIpath\fP specifies fully\-qualified path of the disk; it corresponds
to a unique target name (<target dev=\(aqname\(aq/>) or source file (<source
file=\(aqname\(aq/>) for one of the disk devices attached to \fIdomain\fP (see
also \fBdomblklist\fP for listing these names).
\fIbandwidth\fP specifies copying bandwidth limit in MiB/s, although for
QEMU, it may be non\-zero only for an online domain. For further information

Additionally, if \fIdest\fP is given, \fIformat\fP should be specified to declare
the format of the destination (if \fIformat\fP is omitted, then libvirt
will reuse the format of the source, or with \fI\-\-reuse\-external\fP will
be forced to probe the destination format, which could be a potential
security hole).  The command supports \fI\-\-raw\fP as a boolean flag synonym for
\fI\-\-format=raw\fP\&.  When using \fIdest\fP, the destination is treated as a regular
file unless \fI\-\-blockdev\fP is used to signal that it is a block device. By
default, this command flattens the entire chain; but if \fI\-\-shallow\fP is

If \fI\-\-reuse\-external\fP is specified, then the destination must exist and have
sufficient space to hold the copy. If \fI\-\-shallow\fP is used in
conjunction with \fI\-\-reuse\-external\fP then the pre\-created image must have
guest visible contents identical to guest visible contents of the backing
file of the original image. This may be used to modify the backing file
names on the destination.
.sp
By default, the copy job runs in the background, and consists of two
phases.  Initially, the job must copy all data from the source, and
during this phase, the job can only be canceled to revert back to the
source disk, with no guarantees about the destination.  After this phase
completes, both the source and the destination remain mirrored until a
call to \fBblockjob\fP with the \fI\-\-abort\fP and \fI\-\-pivot\fP flags pivots over
to the copy, or a call without \fI\-\-pivot\fP leaves the destination as a
faithful copy of that point in time.  However, if \fI\-\-wait\fP is specified,
then this command will block until the mirroring phase begins, or cancel
the operation if the optional \fItimeout\fP in seconds elapses or SIGINT is
sent (usually with \fBCtrl\-C\fP).  Using \fI\-\-verbose\fP along with \fI\-\-wait\fP
will produce periodic status updates.  Using \fI\-\-pivot\fP (similar to
\fBblockjob\fP \fI\-\-pivot\fP) or \fI\-\-finish\fP (similar to \fBblockjob\fP \fI\-\-abort\fP)
implies \fI\-\-wait\fP, and will additionally end the job cleanly rather than
leaving things in the mirroring phase.  If job cancellation is triggered
by timeout or by \fI\-\-finish\fP, \fI\-\-async\fP will return control to the user
as fast as possible, otherwise the command may continue to block a little
while longer until the job has actually cancelled.
.sp
\fIpath\fP specifies fully\-qualified path of the disk.
\fIbandwidth\fP specifies copying bandwidth limit in MiB/s. Specifying a negative
value is interpreted as an unsigned long long value that might be essentially
unlimited, but more likely would overflow; it is safer to use 0 for that
purpose. For further information on the \fIbandwidth\fP argument see the
corresponding section for the \fBblockjob\fP command.
Specifying \fIgranularity\fP allows fine\-tuning of the granularity that will be
copied when a dirty region is detected; larger values trigger less
I/O overhead but may end up copying more data overall (the default value is
usually correct); hypervisors may restrict this to be a power of two or fall
within a certain range. Specifying \fIbuf\-size\fP will control how much data can
be simultaneously in\-flight during the copy; larger values use more memory but
may allow faster completion (the default value is usually correct).
.sp
\fI\-\-transient\-job\fP allows specifying that the user does not require the job to
be recovered if the VM crashes or is turned off before the job completes. This
flag removes the restriction of copy jobs to transient domains if that
restriction is applied by the hypervisor.

Manage active block operations.  There are three mutually\-exclusive modes:
\fI\-\-info\fP, \fIbandwidth\fP, and \fI\-\-abort\fP\&.  \fI\-\-async\fP and \fI\-\-pivot\fP imply
abort mode; \fI\-\-raw\fP implies info mode; and if no mode was given, \fI\-\-info\fP
mode is assumed.
.sp
\fIpath\fP specifies fully\-qualified path of the disk; it corresponds
to a unique target name (<target dev=\(aqname\(aq/>) or source file (<source
file=\(aqname\(aq/>) for one of the disk devices attached to \fIdomain\fP (see
also \fBdomblklist\fP for listing these names).
.sp
In \fI\-\-abort\fP mode, the active job on the specified disk will
be aborted.  If \fI\-\-async\fP is also specified, this command will return
immediately, rather than waiting for the cancellation to complete.  If
\fI\-\-pivot\fP is specified, this requests that an active copy or active
commit job be pivoted over to the new image.
.sp
In \fI\-\-info\fP mode, the active job information on the specified
disk will be printed.  By default, the output is a single human\-readable
summary line; this format may change in future versions.  Adding
\fI\-\-raw\fP lists each field of the struct, in a stable format.  If the
\fI\-\-bytes\fP flag is set, then the command errors out if the server could
not supply bytes/s resolution; when omitting the flag, raw output is
listed in MiB/s and human\-readable output automatically selects the
best resolution supported by the server.
.sp
\fIbandwidth\fP can be used to set bandwidth limit for the active job in MiB/s.
If \fI\-\-bytes\fP is specified then the bandwidth value is interpreted in
bytes/s. Specifying a negative value is interpreted as an unsigned long
value or essentially unlimited. The hypervisor can choose whether to
reject the value or convert it to the maximum value allowed. Optionally a
scaled positive number may be used as bandwidth (see \fBNOTES\fP above). Using
\fI\-\-bytes\fP with a scaled value permits a finer granularity to be selected.
A scaled value used without \fI\-\-bytes\fP will be rounded down to MiB/s. Note
that the \fI\-\-bytes\fP may be unsupported by the hypervisor.

Populate a disk from its backing image chain. By default, this command
flattens the entire chain; but if \fIbase\fP is specified, containing the
name of one of the backing files in the chain, then that file becomes
the new backing file and only the intermediate portion of the chain is
pulled.  Once all requested data from the backing image chain has been
pulled, the disk no longer depends on that portion of the backing chain.
.sp
By default, this command returns as soon as possible, and data for
the entire disk is pulled in the background; the progress of the
operation can be checked with \fBblockjob\fP\&.  However, if \fI\-\-wait\fP is
specified, then this command will block until the operation completes,
or cancel the operation if the optional \fItimeout\fP in seconds elapses
or SIGINT is sent (usually with \fBCtrl\-C\fP).  Using \fI\-\-verbose\fP along
with \fI\-\-wait\fP will produce periodic status updates.  If job cancellation
is triggered, \fI\-\-async\fP will return control to the user as fast as
possible, otherwise the command may continue to block a little while
longer until the job is done cleaning up.
.sp
Using the \fI\-\-keep\-relative\fP flag will keep the backing chain names
relative.
.sp
\fIpath\fP specifies fully\-qualified path of the disk; it corresponds
to a unique target name (<target dev=\(aqname\(aq/>) or source file (<source

Create a domain from an XML <file>. Optionally, \fI\-\-validate\fP option can be
passed to validate the format of the input XML file against an internal RNG
schema (identical to using virt\-xml\-validate(1) tool). Domains created using
this command are going to be either transient (temporary ones that will vanish

configuration, leaving the persistent XML untouched (this can come handy during
an automated testing of various configurations all based on the original XML).
See the example below for usage demonstration.
.sp
The domain will be paused if the \fI\-\-paused\fP option is used
and supported by the driver; otherwise it will be running. If \fI\-\-console\fP is

If \fI\-\-autodestroy\fP is requested, then the guest will be automatically
destroyed when virsh closes its connection to libvirt, or otherwise
exits.
.sp
If \fI\-\-pass\-fds\fP is specified, the argument is a comma separated list

Begin a new backup job. If \fIbackupxml\fP is omitted, this defaults to a full
backup using a push model to filenames generated by libvirt; supplying XML
allows fine\-tuning such as requesting an incremental backup relative to an
earlier checkpoint, controlling which disks participate or which
filenames are involved, or requesting the use of a pull model backup.
The \fIbackup\-dumpxml\fP command shows any resulting values assigned by
libvirt. For more information on backup XML, see:

If \fI\-\-reuse\-external\fP is used it instructs libvirt to reuse temporary

For QEMU/KVM with a memory balloon, setting the optional \fI\-\-period\fP to a
value larger than 0 in seconds will allow the balloon driver to return
additional statistics which will be displayed by subsequent \fBdommemstat\fP
commands. Setting the \fI\-\-period\fP to 0 will stop the balloon driver collection,
but does not clear the statistics in the balloon driver. Requires at least
QEMU/KVM 1.5 to be running on the host.
.sp
The \fI\-\-live\fP, \fI\-\-config\fP, and \fI\-\-current\fP flags are only valid when using
the \fI\-\-period\fP option in order to set the collection period for the balloon
driver. If \fI\-\-live\fP is specified, only the running guest collection period
is affected. If \fI\-\-config\fP is specified, affect the next boot of a persistent
guest. If \fI\-\-current\fP is specified, affect the current guest state.
.sp
Both \fI\-\-live\fP and \fI\-\-config\fP flags may be given, but \fI\-\-current\fP is
exclusive. If no flag is specified, behavior is different depending
on the guest state.

Note that this command requires a guest agent configured and running in the

Beware that at least for QEMU, the domain\(aqs process will be terminated when
target disk is used and a new process will be launched when libvirt is asked

This may cause unnecessary delay in delivering stats. Using
\fI\-\-nowait\fP suppresses this behaviour. On the other hand
some statistics might be missing for such domain.

Gets or sets the domain\(aqs system time. When run without any arguments

When \fI\-\-time\fP \fBtime\fP is specified, the domain\(aqs time is
not gotten but set instead. The \fI\-\-now\fP modifier acts like if it was
an alias for \fI\-\-time\fP \fB$now\fP, which means it sets the time that is
currently on the host virsh is running at. In both cases (setting and
getting), time is in seconds relative to Epoch of 1970\-01\-01 in UTC.
The \fI\-\-sync\fP modifies the set behavior a bit: The time passed is
ignored, but the time to set is read from domain\(aqs RTC instead. Please
note, that some hypervisors may require a guest agent to be configured
in order to get or set the guest time.

Dumps the core of a domain to a file for analysis.
If \fI\-\-live\fP is specified, the domain continues to run until the core
dump is complete, rather than pausing up front.
If \fI\-\-crash\fP is specified, the domain is halted with a crashed status,
rather than merely left in a paused state.
If \fI\-\-reset\fP is specified, the domain is reset after successful dump.
Note, these three switches are mutually exclusive.
If \fI\-\-bypass\-cache\fP is specified, the save will avoid the file system
cache, although this may slow down the operation.
If \fI\-\-memory\-only\fP is specified, the file is elf file, and will only
include domain\(aqs memory and cpu common register value. It is very
useful if the domain uses host devices directly.
\fI\-\-format\fP \fIstring\fP is used to specify the format of \(aqmemory\-only\(aq

\fI\-\-min\-guarantee\fP is supported only by ESX hypervisor.  Each of these

kibibytes (blocks of 1024 bytes) if no suffix is present. Libvirt rounds
up to the nearest kibibyte.  Some hypervisors require a larger granularity
than KiB, and requests that are not an even multiple will be rounded up.
For example, vSphere/ESX rounds the parameter up to mebibytes (1024 kibibytes).

Migrate domain to another host.  Add \fI\-\-live\fP for live migration; <\-\-p2p>
for peer\-2\-peer migration; \fI\-\-direct\fP for direct migration; or \fI\-\-tunnelled\fP
for tunnelled migration.  \fI\-\-offline\fP migrates domain definition without
starting the domain on destination and without stopping it on source host.
Offline migration may be used with inactive domains and it must be used with
\fI\-\-persistent\fP option.  \fI\-\-persistent\fP leaves the domain persistent on
destination host, \fI\-\-undefinesource\fP undefines the domain on the source host,
and \fI\-\-suspend\fP leaves the domain paused on the destination host.
\fI\-\-copy\-storage\-all\fP indicates migration with non\-shared storage with full
disk copy, \fI\-\-copy\-storage\-inc\fP indicates migration with non\-shared storage
with incremental copy (same base image shared between source and destination).
In both cases the disk images have to exist on destination host, the
\fI\-\-copy\-storage\-...\fP options only tell libvirt to transfer data from the
images on source host to the images found at the same place on the destination
host. By default only non\-shared non\-readonly images are transferred. Use
\fI\-\-migrate\-disks\fP to explicitly specify a list of disk targets to
transfer via the comma separated \fBdisk\-list\fP argument. \fI\-\-change\-protection\fP
enforces that no incompatible configuration changes will be made to the domain
while the migration is underway; this flag is implicitly enabled when supported
by the hypervisor, but can be explicitly used to reject the migration if the
hypervisor lacks change protection support.  \fI\-\-verbose\fP displays the progress
of migration.  \fI\-\-abort\-on\-error\fP cancels
the migration if a soft error (for example I/O error) happens during the
migration. \fI\-\-postcopy\fP enables post\-copy logic in migration, but does not
actually start post\-copy, i.e., migration is started in pre\-copy mode.
Once migration is running, the user may switch to post\-copy using the
\fBmigrate\-postcopy\fP command sent from another virsh instance or use
\fI\-\-postcopy\-after\-precopy\fP along with \fI\-\-postcopy\fP to let libvirt
automatically switch to post\-copy after the first pass of pre\-copy is finished.
The maximum bandwidth consumed during the post\-copy phase may be limited using
\fI\-\-postcopy\-bandwidth\fP\&. The maximum bandwidth consumed during the pre\-copy phase
may be limited using \fI\-\-bandwidth\fP\&.
.sp
\fI\-\-auto\-converge\fP forces convergence during live migration. The initial
guest CPU throttling rate can be set with \fIauto\-converge\-initial\fP\&. If the
initial throttling rate is not enough to ensure convergence, the rate is
periodically increased by \fIauto\-converge\-increment\fP\&.
.sp
\fI\-\-rdma\-pin\-all\fP can be used with RDMA migration (i.e., when \fImigrateuri\fP
starts with rdma://) to tell the hypervisor to pin all domain\(aqs memory at once
before migration starts rather than letting it pin memory pages as needed. For
QEMU/KVM this requires hard_limit memory tuning element (in the domain XML) to
be used and set to the maximum memory configured for the domain plus any memory
consumed by the QEMU process itself. Beware of setting the memory limit too
high (and thus allowing the domain to lock most of the host\(aqs memory). Doing so
may be dangerous to both the domain and the host itself since the host\(aqs kernel
may run out of memory.
.sp
\fBNote\fP: Individual hypervisors usually do not support all possible types of
migration. For example, QEMU does not support direct migration.
.sp
In some cases libvirt may refuse to migrate the domain because doing so may
lead to potential problems such as data corruption, and thus the migration is
considered unsafe. For QEMU domain, this may happen if the domain uses disks
without explicitly setting cache mode to "none". Migrating such domains is
unsafe unless the disk images are stored on coherent clustered filesystem,
such as GFS2 or GPFS. If you are sure the migration is safe or you just do not
care, use \fI\-\-unsafe\fP to force the migration.
.sp
\fIdname\fP is used for renaming the domain to new name during migration, which
also usually can be omitted.  Likewise, \fI\-\-xml\fP \fBfile\fP is usually
omitted, but can be used to supply an alternative XML file for use on
the destination to supply a larger set of changes to any host\-specific
portions of the domain XML, such as accounting for naming differences
between source and destination in accessing underlying storage.
If \fI\-\-persistent\fP is enabled, \fI\-\-persistent\-xml\fP \fBfile\fP can be used to
supply an alternative XML file which will be used as the persistent domain
definition on the destination host.
.sp
\fI\-\-timeout\fP \fBseconds\fP tells virsh to run a specified action when live
migration exceeds that many seconds.  It can only be used with \fI\-\-live\fP\&.
If \fI\-\-timeout\-suspend\fP is specified, the domain will be suspended after
the timeout and the migration will complete offline; this is the default
if no \fI\-\-timeout\-\e\(ga\(ga option is specified on the command line.  When
*\-\-timeout\-postcopy\fP is used, virsh will switch migration from pre\-copy
to post\-copy upon timeout; migration has to be started with \fI\-\-postcopy\fP
option for this to work.
.sp
\fI\-\-compressed\fP activates compression, the compression method is chosen
with \fI\-\-comp\-methods\fP\&. Supported methods are "mt" and "xbzrle" and
can be used in any combination. When no methods are specified, a hypervisor
default methods will be used. QEMU defaults to "xbzrle". Compression methods
can be tuned further. \fI\-\-comp\-mt\-level\fP sets compression level.
Values are in range from 0 to 9, where 1 is maximum speed and 9 is maximum
compression. \fI\-\-comp\-mt\-threads\fP and \fI\-\-comp\-mt\-dthreads\fP set the number
of compress threads on source and the number of decompress threads on target
respectively. \fI\-\-comp\-xbzrle\-cache\fP sets size of page cache in bytes.
.sp
Providing \fI\-\-tls\fP causes the migration to use the host configured TLS setup
(see migrate_tls_x509_cert_dir in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf) in order to perform
the migration of the domain. Usage requires proper TLS setup for both source
and target. Normally the TLS certificate from the destination host must match
+the host\(aqs name for TLS verification to succeed. When the certificate does not
+match the destination hostname and the expected certificate\(aqs hostname is
+known, \fI\-\-tls\-destination\fP can be used to pass the expected \fIhostname\fP when
+starting the migration.
.sp
\fI\-\-parallel\fP option will cause migration data to be sent over multiple
parallel connections. The number of such connections can be set using
\fI\-\-parallel\-connections\fP\&. Parallel connections may help with saturating the
network link between the source and the target and thus speeding up the
migration.
.sp
Running migration can be canceled by interrupting virsh (usually using
\fBCtrl\-C\fP) or by \fBdomjobabort\fP command sent from another virsh instance.
.sp
The \fIdesturi\fP and \fImigrateuri\fP parameters can be used to control which
destination the migration uses.  \fIdesturi\fP is important for managed
migration, but unused for direct migration; \fImigrateuri\fP is required
for direct migration, but can usually be automatically determined for
managed migration.
.sp
\fBNote\fP: The \fIdesturi\fP parameter for normal migration and peer2peer migration
has different semantics:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
normal migration: the \fIdesturi\fP is an address of the target host as seen from the client machine.
.IP \(bu 2
peer2peer migration: the \fIdesturi\fP is an address of the target host as seen from the source machine.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When \fImigrateuri\fP is not specified, libvirt will automatically determine the
hypervisor specific URI.  Some hypervisors, including QEMU, have an optional
"migration_host" configuration parameter (useful when the host has multiple
network interfaces).  If this is unspecified, libvirt determines a name
by looking up the target host\(aqs configured hostname.
.sp
There are a few scenarios where specifying \fImigrateuri\fP may help:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The configured hostname is incorrect, or DNS is broken.
If a host has a hostname which will not resolve to match one of its public IP addresses, then
libvirt will generate an incorrect URI.  In this case \fImigrateuri\fP should be
explicitly specified, using an IP address, or a correct hostname.
.IP \(bu 2
The host has multiple network interfaces.  If a host has multiple network
interfaces, it might be desirable for the migration data stream to be sent over
a specific interface for either security or performance reasons.  In this case
\fImigrateuri\fP should be explicitly specified, using an IP address associated
with the network to be used.
.IP \(bu 2
The firewall restricts what ports are available.  When libvirt generates a
migration URI, it will pick a port number using hypervisor specific rules.
Some hypervisors only require a single port to be open in the firewalls, while
others require a whole range of port numbers.  In the latter case \fImigrateuri\fP
might be specified to choose a specific port number outside the default range in
order to comply with local firewall policies.
.UNINDENT

See \fI\%https://libvirt.org/migration.html#uris\fP for more details on

.sp
Optional \fIgraphicsuri\fP overrides connection parameters used for automatically
reconnecting a graphical clients at the end of migration. If omitted, libvirt
will compute the parameters based on target host IP address. In case the
client does not have a direct access to the network virtualization hosts are
connected to and needs to connect through a proxy, \fIgraphicsuri\fP may be used
to specify the address the client should connect to. The URI is formed as

error if this parameter is used.

\fBNote\fP: To avoid corrupting file system contents within the domain, you

Saves a running domain (RAM, but not disk state) to a state file so that
it can be restored
later.  Once saved, the domain will no longer be running on the
system, thus the memory allocated for the domain will be free for
other domains to use.  \fBvirsh restore\fP restores from this state file.
If \fI\-\-bypass\-cache\fP is specified, the save will avoid the file system
cache, although this may slow down the operation.
.sp
The progress may be monitored using \fBdomjobinfo\fP virsh command and canceled

.sp
\fBNote\fP: The cpu_shares parameter has a valid value range of 0\-262144; Negative
values are wrapped to positive, and larger values are capped at the maximum.
Therefore, \-1 is a useful shorthand for 262144. On the Linux kernel, the

The \fIcount\fP value may be limited by host, hypervisor, or a limit coming

If the \fI\-\-config\fP flag is specified, the change is made to the stored XML

If \fI\-\-live\fP is specified, the guest domain must be active, and the change

If \fI\-\-current\fP is specified, affect the current guest state.
.sp
When no flags are given, the \fI\-\-live\fP
flag is assumed and the guest domain must be active.  In this situation it

therefore whether the XML configuration is adjusted to make the change
persistent.

If \fI\-\-guest\fP is specified, then the count of cpus is modified in the guest

To allow adding vcpus to persistent definitions that can be later hotunplugged
after the domain is booted it is necessary to specify the \fI\-\-hotpluggable\fP

.sp
The \fI\-\-maximum\fP flag controls the maximum number of virtual cpus that can
be hot\-plugged the next time the domain is booted.  As such, it must only be
used with the \fI\-\-config\fP flag, and not with the \fI\-\-live\fP or the \fI\-\-current\fP

domain.  Without the flag, attempts to undefine an inactive domain with
snapshot metadata will fail.  If the domain is active, this flag is
ignored.

.sp
\fI\-\-nvram\fP and \fI\-\-keep\-nvram\fP specify accordingly to delete or keep nvram
(/domain/os/nvram/) file. If the domain has an nvram file and the flags are

.sp
The \fI\-\-storage\fP flag takes a parameter \fBvolumes\fP, which is a comma separated
list of volume target names or source paths of storage volumes to be removed
along with the undefined domain. Volumes can be undefined and thus removed only
on inactive domains. Volume deletion is only attempted after the domain is
undefined; if not all of the requested volumes could be deleted, the
error message indicates what still remains behind. If a volume path is not
found in the domain definition, it\(aqs treated as if the volume was successfully
deleted. Only volumes managed by libvirt in storage pools can be removed this
way.
(See \fBdomblklist\fP for list of target names associated to a domain).
Example: \-\-storage vda,/path/to/storage.img
.sp
The \fI\-\-remove\-all\-storage\fP flag specifies that all of the domain\(aqs storage
volumes should be deleted.
.sp
The \fI\-\-delete\-storage\-volume\-snapshots\fP (previously \fI\-\-delete\-snapshots\fP)
flag specifies that any snapshots associated with
the storage volume should be deleted as well. Requires the
\fI\-\-remove\-all\-storage\fP flag to be provided. Not all storage drivers
support this option, presently only rbd. Using this when also removing volumes
handled by a storage driver which does not support the flag will result in
failure.
.sp
The flag \fI\-\-wipe\-storage\fP specifies that the storage volumes should be
wiped before removal.
.sp
NOTE: For an inactive domain, the domain name or UUID must be used as the
\fIdomain\fP\&.

Attach a new disk device to the domain.
\fIsource\fP is path for the files and devices. \fItarget\fP controls the bus or
device under which the disk is exposed to the guest OS. It indicates the
"logical" device name; the optional \fItargetbus\fP attribute specifies the type

be \fIfile\fP, \fItap\fP or \fIphy\fP for the Xen
hypervisor depending on the kind of access; or \fIqemu\fP for the QEMU emulator.
Further details to the driver can be passed using \fIsubdriver\fP\&. For Xen
\fIsubdriver\fP can be \fIaio\fP, while for QEMU subdriver should match the format
of the disk source, such as \fIraw\fP or \fIqcow2\fP\&.  Hypervisor default will be

\fBupdate\-device\fP for this usage instead.
\fIalias\fP can set user supplied alias.
\fImode\fP can specify the two specific mode \fIreadonly\fP or \fIshareable\fP\&.
\fIsourcetype\fP can indicate the type of source (block|file)
\fIcache\fP can be one of "default", "none", "writethrough", "writeback",
"directsync" or "unsafe".
\fIio\fP controls specific policies on I/O; QEMU guests support "threads" and "native".
\fIiothread\fP is the number within the range of domain IOThreads to which
this disk may be attached (QEMU only).
\fIserial\fP is the serial of disk device. \fIwwn\fP is the wwn of disk device.
\fIrawio\fP indicates the disk needs rawio capability.
\fIaddress\fP is the address of disk device in the form of
pci:domain.bus.slot.function, scsi:controller.bus.unit,
ide:controller.bus.unit, usb:bus.port, sata:controller.bus.unit or
ccw:cssid.ssid.devno. Virtio\-ccw devices must have their cssid set to 0xfe.

interfaces or bridges,
.sp
\fIhostdev\fP to indicate connection using a passthrough of PCI device

\fB\-\-mac\fP specifies the MAC address of the network interface; if a MAC
address is not given, a new address will be automatically generated

.sp
\fBalias\fP can set user supplied alias.
.sp
\fB\-\-inbound\fP and \fB\-\-outbound\fP control the bandwidth of the

specified, \fI\-\-update\fP is equal to \fI\-\-eject\fP\&. If the device has no source,
and \fIsource\fP is specified, \fI\-\-update\fP is equal to \fI\-\-insert\fP\&. If the device
has source, and \fIsource\fP is specified, \fI\-\-update\fP behaves like combination
of \fI\-\-eject\fP and \fI\-\-insert\fP\&.
If none of \fI\-\-eject\fP, \fI\-\-insert\fP, and \fI\-\-update\fP is specified, \fI\-\-update\fP
is used by default.
The \fI\-\-force\fP option can be used to force media changing.
If \fI\-\-live\fP is specified, alter live configuration of running guest.
If \fI\-\-config\fP is specified, alter persistent configuration, effect observed
on next boot.
\fI\-\-current\fP can be either or both of \fIlive\fP and \fIconfig\fP, depends on
the hypervisor\(aqs implementation.
Both \fI\-\-live\fP and \fI\-\-config\fP flags may be given, but \fI\-\-current\fP is
exclusive. If no flag is specified, behavior is different depending
on hypervisor.
If \fI\-\-print\-xml\fP is specified, the XML that would be used to change media is
printed instead of changing the media.
.SH NODEDEV COMMANDS
.sp
The following commands manipulate host devices that are intended to be
passed through to guest domains via <hostdev> elements in a domain\(aqs
<devices> section.  A node device key is generally specified by the bus
name followed by its address, using underscores between all components,
such as pci_0000_00_02_1, usb_1_5_3, or net_eth1_00_27_13_6a_fe_00.
The \fBnodedev\-list\fP gives the full list of host devices that are known
to libvirt, although this includes devices that cannot be assigned to
a guest (for example, attempting to detach the PCI device that controls
the host\(aqs hard disk controller where the guest\(aqs disk images live could
cause the host system to lock up or reboot).
.sp
For more information on node device definition see:
\fI\%https://libvirt.org/formatnode.html\fP\&.
.sp
Passthrough devices cannot be simultaneously used by the host and its
guest domains, nor by multiple active guests at once.  If the
<hostdev> description of a PCI device includes the attribute \fBmanaged=\(aqyes\(aq\fP,
and the hypervisor driver supports it, then the device is in managed mode, and
attempts to use that passthrough device in an active guest will
automatically behave as if \fBnodedev\-detach\fP (guest start, device
hot\-plug) and \fBnodedev\-reattach\fP (guest stop, device hot\-unplug) were
called at the right points.  If a PCI device is not marked as managed,
then it must manually be detached before guests can use it, and manually
reattached to be returned to the host.  Also, if a device is manually detached,
then the host does not regain control of the device without a matching
reattach, even if the guests use the device in managed mode.

Create a device on the host node that can then be assigned to virtual
machines. Normally, libvirt is able to automatically determine which
host nodes are available for use, but this allows registration of
host hardware that libvirt did not automatically detect.  \fIfile\fP
contains xml for a top\-level <device> description of a node device.

Detach \fInodedev\fP from the host, so that it can safely be used by
guests via <hostdev> passthrough.  This is reversed with
\fBnodedev\-reattach\fP, and is done automatically for managed devices.
.sp
Different backend drivers expect the device to be bound to different
dummy devices. For example, QEMU\(aqs "kvm" backend driver (the default)
expects the device to be bound to pci\-stub, but its "vfio" backend
driver expects the device to be bound to vfio\-pci. The \fI\-\-driver\fP
parameter can be used to specify the desired backend driver.

\fIcap\fP is used to filter the list by capability types, the types must be
separated by comma, e.g. \-\-cap pci,scsi. Valid capability types include
\(aqsystem\(aq, \(aqpci\(aq, \(aqusb_device\(aq, \(aqusb\(aq, \(aqnet\(aq, \(aqscsi_host\(aq, \(aqscsi_target\(aq,

Wait for a class of node device events to occur, and print appropriate
details of events as they happen.  The events can optionally be filtered
by \fInodedev\fP\&.  Using \fI\-\-list\fP as the only argument will provide a list
of possible \fIevent\fP values known by this client, although the connection
might not allow registering for all these events.
.sp
By default, this command is one\-shot, and returns success once an event
occurs; you can send SIGINT (usually via \fBCtrl\-C\fP) to quit immediately.
If \fI\-\-timeout\fP is specified, the command gives up waiting for events
after \fIseconds\fP have elapsed.   With \fI\-\-loop\fP, the command prints all
events until a timeout or interrupt key.
.sp
When \fI\-\-timestamp\fP is used, a human\-readable timestamp will be printed
before the event.
.SH VIRTUAL NETWORK COMMANDS

The following commands manipulate networks. Libvirt has the capability to
define virtual networks which can then be used by domains and linked to
actual network devices. For more detailed information about this feature
see the documentation at \fI\%https://libvirt.org/formatnetwork.html\fP . Many
of the commands for virtual networks are similar to the ones used for domains,

NOTE: When talking to older servers, this command is forced to use a series of

.sp
\fIsection\fP is one of "bridge", "domain", "ip", "ip\-dhcp\-host",
"ip\-dhcp\-range", "forward", "forward\-interface", "forward\-pf",
"portgroup", "dns\-host", "dns\-txt", or "dns\-srv", each section being
named by a concatenation of the xml element hierarchy leading to the
element being changed. For example, "ip\-dhcp\-host" will change a
<host> element that is contained inside a <dhcp> element inside an
<ip> element of the network.
.sp
\fIxml\fP is either the text of a complete xml element of the type being
changed (e.g. "<host mac="00:11:22:33:44:55\(aq ip=\(aq1.2.3.4\(aq/>", or the
name of a file that contains a complete xml element. Disambiguation is
done by looking at the first character of the provided text \- if the
first character is "<", it is xml text, if the first character is not
"<", it is the name of a file that contains the xml text to be used.
.sp
The \fI\-\-parent\-index\fP option is used to specify which of several
parent elements the requested element is in (0\-based). For example, a
dhcp <host> element could be in any one of multiple <ip> elements in
the network; if a parent\-index isn\(aqt provided, the "most appropriate"
<ip> element will be selected (usually the only one that already has a
<dhcp> element), but if \fI\-\-parent\-index\fP is given, that particular
instance of <ip> will get the modification.
.sp
If \fI\-\-live\fP is specified, affect a running network.
If \fI\-\-config\fP is specified, affect the next startup of a persistent network.
If \fI\-\-current\fP is specified, affect the current network state.
Both \fI\-\-live\fP and \fI\-\-config\fP flags may be given, but \fI\-\-current\fP is

The following commands manipulate network ports. Libvirt virtual networks
have ports created when a virtual machine has a virtual network interface
added. In general there should be no need to use any of the commands

.SH INTERFACE COMMANDS
.sp
The following commands manipulate host interfaces.  Often, these host
interfaces can then be used by name within domain <interface> elements
(such as a system\-created bridge interface), but there is no
requirement that host interfaces be tied to any particular guest
configuration XML at all.
.sp
Many of the commands for host interfaces are similar to the ones used
for domains, and the way to name an interface is either by its name or
its MAC address.  However, using a MAC address for an \fIiface\fP
argument only works when that address is unique (if an interface and a
bridge share the same MAC address, which is often the case, then using
that MAC address results in an error due to ambiguity, and you must
resort to a name instead).

.SH STORAGE POOL COMMANDS
.sp
The following commands manipulate storage pools. Libvirt has the
capability to manage various storage solutions, including files, raw
partitions, and domain\-specific formats, used to provide the storage
volumes visible as devices within virtual machines. For more detailed
information about this feature, see the documentation at
\fI\%https://libvirt.org/formatstorage.html\fP . Many of the commands for
pools are similar to the ones used for domains.

.sp
Returns XML describing all possible available storage pool sources that
could be used to create or define a storage pool of a given \fItype\fP\&. If
\fIsrcSpec\fP is provided, it is a file that contains XML to further restrict
the query for pools.
.sp
Not all storage pools support discovery in this manner. Furthermore, for
those that do support discovery, only specific XML elements are required
in order to return valid data, while other elements and even attributes
of some elements are ignored since they are not necessary to find the pool
based on the search criteria. The following lists the supported \fItype\fP
options and the expected minimal XML elements used to perform the search.
.sp
For a "netfs" or "gluster" pool, the minimal expected XML required is the
<host> element with a "name" attribute describing the IP address or hostname
to be used to find the pool. The "port" attribute will be ignored as will
any other provided XML elements in \fIsrcSpec\fP\&.
.sp
For a "logical" pool, the contents of the \fIsrcSpec\fP file are ignored,
although if provided the file must at least exist.
.sp
For an "iscsi" or "iscsi\-direct" pool,
the minimal expect XML required is the <host> element
with a "name" attribute describing the IP address or hostname to be used to
find the pool (the iSCSI server address). Optionally, the "port" attribute
may be provided, although it will default to 3260. Optionally, an <initiator>
XML element with a "name" attribute may be provided to further restrict the
iSCSI target search to a specific initiator for multi\-iqn iSCSI storage pools.

.sp
Options \fI\-\-overwrite\fP and \fI\-\-no\-overwrite\fP can only be used for
\fBpool\-build\fP a filesystem, disk, or logical pool.
.sp
For a file system pool if neither flag is specified, then \fBpool\-build\fP
just makes the target path directory and no attempt to run mkfs on the
target volume device. If \fI\-\-no\-overwrite\fP is specified, it probes to
determine if a filesystem already exists on the target device, returning
an error if one exists or using mkfs to format the target device if not.
If \fI\-\-overwrite\fP is specified, mkfs is always executed and any existing
data on the target device is overwritten unconditionally.
.sp
For a disk pool, if neither of them is specified or \fI\-\-no\-overwrite\fP
is specified, \fBpool\-build\fP will check the target volume device for
existing filesystems or partitions before attempting to write a new
label on the target volume device. If the target volume device already
has a label, the command will fail. If \fI\-\-overwrite\fP is specified,
then no check will be made on the target volume device prior to writing
a new label. Writing of the label uses the pool source format type
or "dos" if not specified.
.sp
For a logical pool, if neither of them is specified or \fI\-\-no\-overwrite\fP
is specified, \fBpool\-build\fP will check the target volume devices for
existing filesystems or partitions before attempting to initialize
and format each device for usage by the logical pool. If any target
volume device already has a label, the command will fail. If
\fI\-\-overwrite\fP is specified, then no check will be made on the target
volume devices prior to initializing and formatting each device. Once
all the target volume devices are properly formatted via pvcreate,
the volume group will be created using all the devices.

.sp
[\fI\-\-source\-host hostname\fP] provides the source hostname for pools backed
by storage from a remote server (pool types netfs, iscsi, rbd, sheepdog,
gluster).
.sp
[\fI\-\-source\-path path\fP] provides the source directory path for pools backed
by directories (pool type dir).
.sp
[\fI\-\-source\-dev path\fP] provides the source path for pools backed by physical
devices (pool types fs, logical, disk, iscsi, zfs).
.sp
[\fI\-\-source\-name name\fP] provides the source name for pools backed by storage
from a named element (pool types logical, rbd, sheepdog, gluster).
.sp
[\fI\-\-target path\fP] is the path for the mapping of the storage pool into
the host file system.
.sp
[\fI\-\-source\-format format\fP] provides information about the format of the
pool (pool types fs, netfs, disk, logical).
.sp
[\fI\-\-auth\-type authtype\fP \fI\-\-auth\-username username\fP
[\fI\-\-secret\-usage usage\fP | \fI\-\-secret\-uuid uuid\fP]]
provides the elements required to generate authentication credentials for
the storage pool. The \fIauthtype\fP is either chap for iscsi \fItype\fP pools or
ceph for rbd \fItype\fP pools. Either the secret \fIusage\fP or \fIuuid\fP value may
be provided, but not both.
.sp
[\fI\-\-source\-protocol\-ver ver\fP] provides the NFS protocol version number used
to contact the server\(aqs NFS service via nfs mount option \(aqnfsvers=n\(aq. It is
expect the \fIver\fP value is an unsigned integer.

\fI\-\-adapter\-parent\-wwnn parent_wwnn\fP \fIadapter\-parent\-wwpn parent_wwpn\fP |
\fI\-\-adapter\-parent\-fabric\-wwn parent_fabric_wwn\fP]]
defines the wwnn and wwpn to be used for the fc_host adapter type pool.
Optionally provide the parent scsi_hostN node device to be used for the
vHBA either by parent name, parent_wwnn and parent_wwpn, or parent_fabric_wwn.
The parent name could change between reboots if the hardware environment
changes, so providing the parent_wwnn and parent_wwpn ensure usage of the
same physical HBA even if the scsi_hostN node device changes. Usage of the
parent_fabric_wwn allows a bit more flexibility to choose an HBA on the
same storage fabric in order to define the pool.
.sp
[\fI\-\-build\fP] [[\fI\-\-overwrite\fP] | [\fI\-\-no\-overwrite\fP]] perform a

.sp
For a "logical" pool only [\fI\-\-name\fP] needs to be provided. The
[\fI\-\-source\-name\fP] if provided must match the Volume Group name.
If not provided, one will be generated using the [\fI\-\-name\fP]. If

.SH SNAPSHOT COMMANDS
.sp
The following commands manipulate domain snapshots.  Snapshots take the
disk, memory, and device state of a domain at a point\-of\-time, and save it
for future use.  They have many uses, from saving a "clean" copy of an OS
image to saving a domain\(aqs state before a potentially destructive operation.
Snapshots are identified with a unique name.  See
\fI\%https://libvirt.org/formatsnapshot.html\fP for documentation of the XML format
used to represent properties of snapshots.

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Create a snapshot for domain \fIdomain\fP with the properties specified in
\fIxmlfile\fP\&.   Optionally, the \fI\-\-validate\fP option can be passed to
validate the format of the input XML file against an internal RNG
schema (identical to using the virt\-xml\-validate(1) tool). Normally,
the only properties settable for a domain snapshot
are the <name> and <description> elements, as well as <disks> if
\fI\-\-disk\-only\fP is given; the rest of the fields are
ignored, and automatically filled in by libvirt.  If \fIxmlfile\fP is
completely omitted, then libvirt will choose a value for all fields.
The new snapshot will become current, as listed by \fBsnapshot\-current\fP\&.
.sp
If \fI\-\-halt\fP is specified, the domain will be left in an inactive state
after the snapshot is created.
.sp
If \fI\-\-disk\-only\fP is specified, the snapshot will only include disk
content rather than the usual full system snapshot with vm state.  Disk
snapshots are captured faster than full system snapshots, but reverting to a
disk snapshot may require fsck or journal replays, since it is like
the disk state at the point when the power cord is abruptly pulled;
and mixing \fI\-\-halt\fP and \fI\-\-disk\-only\fP loses any data that was not
flushed to disk at the time.
.sp
If \fI\-\-redefine\fP is specified, then all XML elements produced by
\fBsnapshot\-dumpxml\fP are valid; this can be used to migrate snapshot
hierarchy from one machine to another, to recreate hierarchy for the
case of a transient domain that goes away and is later recreated with
the same name and UUID, or to make slight alterations in the snapshot
metadata (such as host\-specific aspects of the domain XML embedded in
the snapshot).  When this flag is supplied, the \fIxmlfile\fP argument
is mandatory, and the domain\(aqs current snapshot will not be altered
unless the \fI\-\-current\fP flag is also given.
.sp
If \fI\-\-no\-metadata\fP is specified, then the snapshot data is created,
but any metadata is immediately discarded (that is, libvirt does not
treat the snapshot as current, and cannot revert to the snapshot
unless \fI\-\-redefine\fP is later used to teach libvirt about the
metadata again).
.sp
If \fI\-\-reuse\-external\fP is specified, and the snapshot XML requests an
external snapshot with a destination of an existing file, then the
destination must exist and be pre\-created with correct format and
metadata. The file is then reused; otherwise, a snapshot is refused
to avoid losing contents of the existing files.
.sp
If \fI\-\-quiesce\fP is specified, libvirt will try to use guest agent
to freeze and unfreeze domain\(aqs mounted file systems. However,
if domain has no guest agent, snapshot creation will fail.
Currently, this requires \fI\-\-disk\-only\fP to be passed as well.
.sp
If \fI\-\-atomic\fP is specified, libvirt will guarantee that the snapshot
either succeeds, or fails with no changes; not all hypervisors support
this.  If this flag is not specified, then some hypervisors may fail
after partially performing the action, and \fBdumpxml\fP must be used to
see whether any partial changes occurred.
.sp
If \fI\-\-live\fP is specified, libvirt takes the snapshot while
the guest is running. Both disk snapshot and domain memory snapshot are
taken. This increases the size of the memory image of the external
snapshot. This is currently supported only for full system external snapshots.
.sp
Existence of snapshot metadata will prevent attempts to \fBundefine\fP
a persistent domain.  However, for transient domains, snapshot
metadata is silently lost when the domain quits running (whether
by command such as \fBdestroy\fP or by internal guest action).
.sp
For now, it is not possible to create snapshots in a domain that has
checkpoints, although this restriction will be lifted in a future
release.

\fIsnapshot\-create\fP is output, rather than actually creating a snapshot.
Otherwise, if \fI\-\-halt\fP is specified, the domain will be left in an
inactive state after the snapshot is created, and if \fI\-\-disk\-only\fP
is specified, the snapshot will not include vm state.
.sp
The \fI\-\-memspec\fP option can be used to control whether a full system snapshot
is internal or external.  The \fI\-\-memspec\fP flag is mandatory, followed
by a \fBmemspec\fP of the form \fB[file=]name[,snapshot=type]\fP, where
type can be \fBno\fP, \fBinternal\fP, or \fBexternal\fP\&.  To include a literal
comma in \fBfile=name\fP, escape it with a second comma. \fI\-\-memspec\fP cannot
be used together with \fI\-\-disk\-only\fP\&.
.sp
The \fI\-\-diskspec\fP option can be used to control how \fI\-\-disk\-only\fP and
external full system snapshots create external files.  This option can occur
multiple times, according to the number of <disk> elements in the domain
xml.  Each <diskspec> is in the
form \fBdisk[,snapshot=type][,driver=type][,stype=type][,file=name]\fP\&.
A \fIdiskspec\fP must be provided for disks backed by block devices as libvirt
doesn\(aqt auto\-generate file names for those.  The optional \fBstype\fP parameter
allows to control the type of the source file. Supported values are \(aqfile\(aq
(default) and \(aqblock\(aq. To exclude a disk from an external snapshot use
\fB\-\-diskspec disk,snapshot=no\fP\&.
.sp
To include a literal comma in \fBdisk\fP or in \fBfile=name\fP, escape it with a
second comma.  A literal \fI\-\-diskspec\fP must precede each \fBdiskspec\fP unless
all three of \fIdomain\fP, \fIname\fP, and \fIdescription\fP are also present.
For example, a diskspec of "vda,snapshot=external,file=/path/to,,new"
results in the following XML:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<disk name=\(aqvda\(aq snapshot=\(aqexternal\(aq>
  <source file=\(aq/path/to,new\(aq/>
</disk>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If \fI\-\-reuse\-external\fP is specified, and the domain XML or \fIdiskspec\fP
option requests an external snapshot with a destination of an existing
file, then the destination must exist and be pre\-created with correct
format and metadata. The file is then reused; otherwise, a snapshot
is refused to avoid losing contents of the existing files.
.sp
If \fI\-\-quiesce\fP is specified, libvirt will try to use guest agent
to freeze and unfreeze domain\(aqs mounted file systems. However,
if domain has no guest agent, snapshot creation will fail.
Currently, this requires \fI\-\-disk\-only\fP to be passed as well.
.sp
If \fI\-\-no\-metadata\fP is specified, then the snapshot data is created,
but any metadata is immediately discarded (that is, libvirt does not
treat the snapshot as current, and cannot revert to the snapshot
unless \fBsnapshot\-create\fP is later used to teach libvirt about the
metadata again).
.sp
If \fI\-\-atomic\fP is specified, libvirt will guarantee that the snapshot
either succeeds, or fails with no changes; not all hypervisors support
this.  If this flag is not specified, then some hypervisors may fail
after partially performing the action, and \fBdumpxml\fP must be used to
see whether any partial changes occurred.
.sp
If \fI\-\-live\fP is specified, libvirt takes the snapshot while the guest is
running. This increases the size of the memory image of the external
snapshot. This is currently supported only for external full system snapshots.
.sp
For now, it is not possible to create snapshots in a domain that has
checkpoints, although this restriction will be lifted in a future
release.

use of \fI\-\-descendants\fP is implied.  This option is not compatible
with \fI\-\-roots\fP\&.  Note that the starting point of \fI\-\-from\fP or

If \fI\-\-leaves\fP is specified, the list will be filtered to just

children.  (Note that omitting both options does no filtering,
while providing both options will either produce the same list

Filtering options are not compatible with \fI\-\-tree\fP\&.
.sp
If \fI\-\-metadata\fP is specified, the list will be filtered to just
snapshots that involve libvirt metadata, and thus would prevent
\fBundefine\fP of a persistent domain, or be lost on \fBdestroy\fP of
a transient domain.  Likewise, if \fI\-\-no\-metadata\fP is specified,
the list will be filtered to just snapshots that exist without
the need for libvirt metadata.

If \fI\-\-inactive\fP is specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots
that were taken when the domain was shut off.  If \fI\-\-active\fP is

when the domain was running, and where the snapshot includes the
memory state to revert to that running state.  If \fI\-\-disk\-only\fP is

when the domain was running, but where the snapshot includes only
disk state.
.sp
If \fI\-\-internal\fP is specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots

Revert the given domain to the snapshot specified by \fIsnapshot\fP, or to
the current snapshot with \fI\-\-current\fP\&.  Be aware
that this is a destructive action; any changes in the domain since the last
snapshot was taken will be lost.  Also note that the state of the domain after
snapshot\-revert is complete will be the state of the domain at the time
the original snapshot was taken.
.sp
Normally, reverting to a snapshot leaves the domain in the state it was
at the time the snapshot was created, except that a disk snapshot with
no vm state leaves the domain in an inactive state.  Passing either the
\fI\-\-running\fP or \fI\-\-paused\fP flag will perform additional state changes
(such as booting an inactive domain, or pausing a running domain).  Since
transient domains cannot be inactive, it is required to use one of these
flags when reverting to a disk snapshot of a transient domain.
.sp
There are a number of cases where a snapshot revert involves extra risk, which
requires the use of \fI\-\-force\fP to proceed:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
One is the case of a snapshot that lacks full domain information for
reverting configuration (such as snapshots created prior to libvirt
0.9.5); since libvirt cannot prove that the current configuration matches
what was in use at the time of the snapshot, supplying \fI\-\-force\fP assures
libvirt that the snapshot is compatible with the current configuration
(and if it is not, the domain will likely fail to run).
.IP \(bu 2
Another is the case of reverting from a running domain to an active
state where a new hypervisor has to be created rather than reusing the
existing hypervisor, because it implies drawbacks such as breaking any
existing VNC or Spice connections; this condition happens with an active
snapshot that uses a provably incompatible configuration, as well as with
an inactive snapshot that is combined with the \fI\-\-start\fP or \fI\-\-pause\fP
flag.
.IP \(bu 2
Also, libvirt will refuse to restore snapshots of inactive QEMU domains
while there is managed saved state. This is because those snapshots do not
contain memory state and will therefore not replace the existing memory
state. This ends up switching a disk underneath a running system and will
likely cause extensive filesystem corruption or crashes due to swap content
mismatches when run.

.SH CHECKPOINT COMMANDS
.sp
The following commands manipulate domain checkpoints.  Checkpoints serve as
a point in time to identify which portions of a guest\(aqs disks have changed
after that time, making it possible to perform incremental and differential
backups.  Checkpoints are identified with a unique name.  See
\fI\%https://libvirt.org/formatcheckpoint.html\fP for documentation of the XML
format used to represent properties of checkpoints.

format of the input XML file will be validated against an internal RNG
schema (idential to using the virt\-xml\-validate(1) tool). If
\fIxmlfile\fP is completely omitted, then libvirt will create a
checkpoint with a name based on the current time.
.sp
If \fI\-\-redefine\fP is specified, then all XML elements produced by
\fBcheckpoint\-dumpxml\fP are valid; this can be used to migrate
checkpoint hierarchy from one machine to another, to recreate
hierarchy for the case of a transient domain that goes away and is
later recreated with the same name and UUID, or to make slight
alterations in the checkpoint metadata (such as host\-specific aspects
of the domain XML embedded in the checkpoint).  When this flag is
supplied, the \fIxmlfile\fP argument is mandatory.
.sp
If \fI\-\-quiesce\fP is specified, libvirt will try to use guest agent
to freeze and unfreeze domain\(aqs mounted file systems. However,
if domain has no guest agent, checkpoint creation will fail.
.sp
Existence of checkpoint metadata will prevent attempts to \fBundefine\fP
a persistent domain.  However, for transient domains, checkpoint
metadata is silently lost when the domain quits running (whether
by command such as \fBdestroy\fP or by internal guest action).

For now, it is not possible to create checkpoints in a domain that has
snapshots, although this restriction will be lifted in a future

however, the network filter binding commands provide a way to make use
of the network filters directly.

.sp
Associate a network port with a network filter. The network filter backend
will immediately attempt to instantiate the filter rules on the port. This
command may be used to associate a filter with a currently running guest
that does not have a filter defined for a specific network port. Since the
bindings are generally automatically managed by the hypervisor, using this
command to define a filter for a network port and then starting the guest
afterwards may prevent the guest from starting if it attempts to use the
network port and finds a filter already defined.

Disassociate a network port from a network filter. The network filter
backend will immediately tear down the filter rules that exist on the
port. This command may be used to remove the network port binding for
a filter currently in use for the guest while the guest is running
without needing to restart the guest. Restoring the network port binding
filter for the running guest would be accomplished by using
\fInwfilter\-binding\-create\fP\&.

.SH HYPERVISOR-SPECIFIC COMMANDS
.sp
NOTE: Use of the following commands is \fBstrongly\fP discouraged.  They
can cause libvirt to become confused and do the wrong thing on subsequent
operations.  Once you have used these commands, please do not report
problems to the libvirt developers; the reports will be ignored.  If
you find that these commands are the only way to accomplish something,
then it is better to request that the feature be added as a first\-class
citizen in the regular libvirt library.

.sp
Attach an externally launched QEMU process to the libvirt QEMU driver.
The QEMU process must have been created with a monitor connection
using the UNIX driver. Ideally the process will also have had the
\(aq\-name\(aq argument specified.

.UNINDENT
.sp
Not all functions of libvirt are expected to work reliably after
attaching to an externally launched QEMU process. There may be
issues with the guest ABI changing upon migration and device hotplug
or hotunplug may not work. The attached environment should be considered
primarily read\-only.
.SS qemu\-monitor\-command
.sp
\fBSyntax:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.ft C
qemu\-monitor\-command domain { [\-\-hmp] | [\-\-pretty] [\-\-return\-value] } command...
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Send an arbitrary monitor command \fIcommand\fP to domain \fIdomain\fP through the
QEMU monitor.  The results of the command will be printed on stdout.
.sp
If more than one argument is provided for \fIcommand\fP, they are concatenated with
a space in between before passing the single command to the monitor.
.sp
Note that libvirt uses the QMP to talk to qemu so \fIcommand\fP must be valid JSON
in QMP format to work properly.
.sp
If \fI\-\-pretty\fP is given the QMP reply is pretty\-printed.
.sp
If \fI\-\-return\-value\fP is given the \(aqreturn\(aq key of the QMP response object is
extracted rather than passing through the full reply from QEMU.
.sp
If \fI\-\-hmp\fP is passed, the command is considered to be a human monitor command
and libvirt will automatically convert it into QMP and convert the result back.
.SS qemu\-agent\-command
.sp
\fBSyntax:\fP

.UNINDENT
.sp
Send an arbitrary guest agent command \fIcommand\fP to domain \fIdomain\fP through
QEMU agent.
\fI\-\-timeout\fP, \fI\-\-async\fP and \fI\-\-block\fP options are exclusive.
\fI\-\-timeout\fP requires timeout seconds \fIseconds\fP and it must be positive.
When \fI\-\-aysnc\fP is given, the command waits for timeout whether success or
failed. And when \fI\-\-block\fP is given, the command waits forever with blocking
timeout.
.SS qemu\-monitor\-event
.sp
\fBSyntax:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.ft C
qemu\-monitor\-event [domain] [\-\-event event\-name]

  [\-\-timestamp]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Wait for arbitrary QEMU monitor events to occur, and print out the
details of events as they happen.  The events can optionally be filtered
by \fIdomain\fP or \fIevent\-name\fP\&.  The \(aqquery\-events\(aq QMP command can be
used via \fIqemu\-monitor\-command\fP to learn what events are supported.
If \fI\-\-regex\fP is used, \fIevent\-name\fP is a basic regular expression
instead of a literal string.  If \fI\-\-no\-case\fP is used, \fIevent\-name\fP
will match case\-insensitively.
.sp
By default, this command is one\-shot, and returns success once an event
occurs; you can send SIGINT (usually via \fBCtrl\-C\fP) to quit immediately.
If \fI\-\-timeout\fP is specified, the command gives up waiting for events
after \fIseconds\fP have elapsed.  With \fI\-\-loop\fP, the command prints all
events until a timeout or interrupt key.  If \fI\-\-pretty\fP is specified,
any JSON event details are pretty\-printed for better legibility.
.sp
When \fI\-\-timestamp\fP is used, a human\-readable timestamp will be printed
before the event, and the timing information provided by QEMU will be
omitted.
.SS lxc\-enter\-namespace

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Enter the namespace of \fIdomain\fP and execute the command \fB/path/to/binary\fP
passing the requested args. The binary path is relative to the container
root filesystem, not the host root filesystem. The binary will inherit the
environment variables / console visible to virsh. The command will be run
with the same sVirt context and cgroups placement as processes within the
container. This command only works when connected to the LXC hypervisor
driver.  This command succeeds only if \fB/path/to/binary\fP has 0 exit status.
.sp
By default the new process will run with the security label of the new
parent container. Use the \fI\-\-noseclabel\fP option to instead have the
process keep the same security label as \fBvirsh\fP\&.
.SH ENVIRONMENT

.IP \(bu 2
VIRSH_DEFAULT_CONNECT_URI
.sp
The hypervisor to connect to by default. Set this to a URI, in the same

The hypervisor to connect to by default. Set this to a URI, in the
same format as accepted by the \fBconnect\fP option. This overrides
the default URI set in any client config file and prevents libvirt
from probing for drivers.
.IP \(bu 2
VISUAL
.sp
The editor to use by the \fBedit\fP and related options.
